# Laptop-Price-Predictor

## About the Project

This project is aimed at creating a regression model used to predict the price of laptop when provided with the laptop specifications. After trying and testing various models XGBoost was selected as the model of choice. A user friendly front-end is created using streamlit to make the usage of model easier.

## EDA

Performed EDA using matplotlib to observe patterns in data, also extracted features from the current dataset which was helpful in improving the performance of the model.
